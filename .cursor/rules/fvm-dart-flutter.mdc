# Use FVM for Dart and Flutter

When running Dart or Flutter commands in this project, always use FVM so the version from `.fvmrc` is used.

## Commands

- Use **`fvm dart`** instead of `dart` (e.g. `fvm dart run`, `fvm dart pub get`, `fvm dart analyze`)
- Use **`fvm flutter`** instead of `flutter` (e.g. `fvm flutter run`, `fvm flutter pub get`, `fvm flutter test`)

## Examples

```bash
# ✅ GOOD
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter run
fvm dart analyze
fvm dart test

# ❌ BAD (bypasses FVM)
flutter pub get
dart analyze
```

## When editing or suggesting commands

- In terminal commands, scripts, and documentation: use `fvm dart` and `fvm flutter`.
- If the project has `.fvmrc`, assume FVM is required and never suggest bare `dart` or `flutter` for local runs.
