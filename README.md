# Locmate 📍

**Locmate** is an all-in-one localization management suite for Dart and Flutter. It bridges the gap between raw translation files and a user-friendly management interface. It is a visual editor for Application Resource Bundle (`.arb`) localization files, designed for projects using the [intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) package. The editor runs locally, so you can use Git and never have to upload or download localization files.

## ❤️ Open Source & Community

Locmate is 100% Free and Open Source. It was built by developers, for developers, to make the localization process less painful.
